# Business Case 

The purpose of AIDAP is to make it easier for students, teachers, and staff to get the information they need for school, like class schedules, announcements, and deadlines, all in one place. Instead of searching through different websites, AIDAP lets you ask questions and get answers using chat or voice. This saves time and helps everyone stay up to date.  
To reach this goal, AIDAP is built with the following important features for each group of users:

**General:**  
AIDAP gives everyone a simple way to find campus information and services just by talking or typing, instead of hunting through lots of websites or apps. It connects to things like LMS, course registration, calendars, and school email. You can use it on your phone or computer, and it always tries to understand what you mean, even if you use everyday words. It also follows all privacy rules to keep your data safe.

**Students:**  
Students can ask questions about their classes, assignments, or school events and get fast answers in one place. They’ll receive reminders and alerts about important deadlines, changes, or announcements. The system also lets them see all their important information, like schedules and grades, on a personal dashboard. Students can change their notification or language settings and get support on different devices, with answers coming quickly and reliably.

**Lecturers:**  
Lecturers can put course materials and announcements into AIDAP so students see them right away. They can send reminders, check how their class is doing, like grades or participation, and quickly answer student questions. If something unusual happens, like many students missing the same assignment, the lecturer gets an alert. They can also manage TA access and trust that only the right people can make changes.

**Administration:**  
Administrators use AIDAP to manage the connection to other school systems, control who can use which features, and send messages or announcements to everyone. They can see how the system is being used and make sure everything runs smoothly and follows school rules, even as the university grows (in population).

**System Maintainers:**  
System maintainers are the technical team. They make sure AIDAP is always running, even when updates happen, and keep track of its performance. They set up and fine-tune the AI parts, monitor for issues, back up important data, and make the system better over time, all while keeping it secure so only the right people can fix problems.

**Data Source Systems:**  
AIDAP connects to all the university’s main programs, like class lists, calendar, and email, using standard ways of sharing data. If one system goes down or has a problem, AIDAP lets the right people know and tries to keep everything working together smoothly. It always checks that the data is correct and up to date.
