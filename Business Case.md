# AIDAP Overview

The purpose of **AIDAP** is to make it easier for students, teachers, and staff to get the information they need for school, like class schedules, announcements, and deadlines, all in one place. Instead of searching through different websites, AIDAP lets you ask questions and get answers using **chat or voice**. This saves time and helps everyone stay up to date.
