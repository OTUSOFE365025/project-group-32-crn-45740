# Business Case 

The purpose of the AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is to enhance the academic experience by providing a single point of access to resources and information. Currently, it is inefficient for administrators, employees, and students to use numerous platforms. Multiple portals are difficult to use for simple, repeated operations, and fragmented systems cause communication delays and missed deadlines. By providing a unified conversational interface for tasks like scheduling, deadlines, and notifications, AIDAP fills a demand for a digital assistant.

The overall objective of the suggested solution is to improve academic and student access to information, and it is meant for usage by lecturers, administrators, maintainers, and students. The program has an interface that is customized to the user. Students can access timetables, grades, and deadlines through the conversational interface that the AIDAP offers. The solution gives lecturers faster course analytics and quicker access to student communication. All things considered, by adding a conversational interface and tailored data, the system outperforms the current ones, including LMS. Although the technology has made monitoring and maintenance easier, even the administrators and maintainers can profit from it.

Expected benefits of AIDAP: 

Students: 
Students can ask questions about their classes, assignments, or school events and get fast answers in one place. They’ll receive reminders and alerts about important deadlines, changes, or announcements. The system also lets them see all their important information, like schedules and grades, on a personal dashboard. Students can change their notification or language settings and get support on different devices, with answers coming quickly and reliably.

Lecturers: 
Lecturers can put course materials and announcements into AIDAP so students see them right away. They can send reminders, check how their class is doing, like grades or participation, and quickly answer student questions. If something unusual happens, like many students missing the same assignment, the lecturer gets an alert. They can also manage TA access and trust that only the right people can make changes.

Administration:  
Administrators use AIDAP to manage the connection to other school systems, control who can use which features, and send messages or announcements to everyone. They can see how the system is being used and make sure everything runs smoothly and follows school rules, even as the university grows (in population).

System Maintainers:
System maintainers are the technical team. They make sure AIDAP is always running, even when updates happen, and keep track of its performance. They set up and fine-tune the AI parts, monitor for issues, back up important data, and make the system better over time, all while keeping it secure so only the right people can fix problems.

**Data Source Systems:
AIDAP connects to all the university’s main programs, like class lists, calendar, and email, using standard ways of sharing data. If one system goes down or has a problem, AIDAP lets the right people know and tries to keep everything working together smoothly. It always checks that the data is correct and up to date.
