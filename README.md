# SOFE3650 - Software Architecture Design Project – Attribute Driven Design (ADD)

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to demonstrate a methodological set of steps in designing a software architecture using the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) approach. The project applies ADD to a set of requirements (listed in Appendix A) to create a structured and well-documented architecture for the software application.
