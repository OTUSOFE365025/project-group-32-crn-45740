## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to demonstrate a methodological set of steps in designing a software architecture using the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) approach. The project applies ADD to a set of requirements (listed in Appendix A) to create a structured and well-documented architecture for the software application.

### Deliverable 1 – Requirements Analysis
**Due Date:** Oct 28  
This deliverable focuses on identifying the foundational requirements and concerns before commencing the ADD process.

## Deliverables
